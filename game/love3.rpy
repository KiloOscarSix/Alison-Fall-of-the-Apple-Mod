    a "So why do you do the things you do?"

    M "Sometimes I do things without thinking them through. Other things I do even when I know the dangers."

    M "Like today, for example. I knew those cops might have turned out to be crooked and end up shooting me."

    M "But I had to protect Alison. I made her a promise."

    a "Promise?"

    M "Yes, when you tell someone that you will do something and do everything you can to actually follow through with it."

    M "You are impossible."
