    c "Those hypnotizing gorgeous boobies have me following them around like a lost puppy."

    K "Hahaha. I love you, baby, but you better try to focus on where we are going more."

    c "So cruel!"

    K "You're the captain, so you better get us there safe!"

    K "These puppies are in need of fresh air."

    c "This is going to be a dangerous trip for sure."

    Mls "[mc] was upset before he left, we almost had our first argument..."

    Mls "I pushed him on something stupid because I got a little jealous of how open he is with Alison."

    Sh "This Alison girl sounds like a world of trouble so far... Want me to drop her in the water?"

    Mls "Haha, are you fucking mad? [mc] would skin us both alive and I'm not even being funny."

    Sh "Seriously? He likes her that much already?"

    A "Ungh, I hate this boat. I hate water so much!"

    C "I didn't know you hated water, sis... But I do know one thing for sure."

    A "What Caroline?"

    C "That you are in love with an over the hill forty-year-old guy named [mc]."

    A "What?! [mc] is not that old, silly. Or are you just being mean on purpose?"

    C "Duh! If he is older than you by two or three years, he is ancient, sis."

    C "What on earth do you see in him anyway? Don't get me wrong I understand he saved you and all."

    C "But are you seriously going to date some old guy who can probably not even get it up?"

    A "Get it up?"

    C "His dick, sis... Don't tell me you don't even know what that is now."

    A "Caroline! Watch your mouth... You may think you're some hotshot mature woman..."

    A "But you are not even eighteen yet, so don't forget your manners!"

    C "Sorry. I meant his penis, okay? Is that better?"

    A "*Sigh* Just to shut you up once and for all, I will say this only once."

    A "You have no idea what you're talking about... If anything I've rarely seen it down!"

    A "Okay? The complete opposite of your cruel and childish joke."

    C "Whoa, you really are in love! My sister is in love for real!"

    C "Sorry Alison, I had to make sure that you two had not had sex already."

    A "Huh?! Of course not, you little brat."

    C "So have you thought about it?"

    A "*Blushes* Well, no not really... You know what happened to me by now."

    C "I'm really sorry, I didn't mean to upset you, sis... I just figured since you love him..."

    C "It would be nothing like that, you know that, right?"

    A "And how would you know? Have you actually had sex with someone?"

    C "Well, no, at least not yet! But I know stuff, okay? School and the internet teaches you."

    A "I see... So you are still..."

    C "Don't you dare say it."

    A "A virgin like me... And yet you have advice for me in love."

    C "Hey! I said don't you dare say it. I'm going to take [mc] away from you if you don't stop."

    A "Oh you will huh? Haha, you're welcome to try, sis."

    C "Are you serious? You don't mind if I try to steal him away from you?"

    A "I don't mind because you would never be able to, sis... Not you nor anybody else."

    A "You'll see what I mean when you've lived with us for a while longer."

    A "[mc] would die for me and I am not even exaggerating, Caroline."

    C "Wow. Are you for real?"

    A "Yes, believe me. But if you wish to try just to satisfy your curiosity then go for it."

    C "So, um, if that old guy boyfriend of yours wants to sleep with me... You won't mind?"

    A "Stop daydreaming! And get your mind out of the gutter."

    A "You are not even eighteen."

    C "So you are scared after all."

    A "Okay fine, if [mc] lets you sleep with him in his bed like I do, you win, okay?"

    A "When you turn eighteen you can do whatever you like then... He already sleeps with Melissa anyhow."

    C "Okay and what?! He is having sex with that gorgeous redhead and you still love him?"

    A "Why wouldn't I? He didn't trick me, deceive me or lie to me and never even asked for anything."

    A "In fact, they both made sure I was okay with the idea before Melissa was even allowed to stay with us."

    C "Holy shit... You really have some power over this guy, sis. Interesting."

    A "*Thinks.* Well when you put it that way, I suppose I really do, huh?"

    C "*Chuckles softly* Well, I think I need to teach you a thing or two about that kind of power, sis."

    A "You little brat. I love you and fine, I'll let you teach me all the dirty tricks, if it makes you happy!"

    C "Yay! I love you, Alison. Although this was and still is one fucked up day."

    A "Language!"

    C "Whoops. I meant one poopy day. I still wouldn't change it for anything in the world."

    A "I have never been so happy in my entire life, Caroline... Mom would be so happy to see us together."

    A "Her last words to me were, help your sister if you can."

    C "I love you so so much, Alison."

    A "I love you too, baby sis."

    Sh "Anticipation is killing me!"

    Mls "Haha! The best part is she is not even aware of it."

    Mls "Which means she is not doing it on purpose... Imagine if she wanted to control him."

    Sh "Oh, fuck me sideways."

    Mls "*Moans* That's very tempting but I bet [mc] wouldn't be very happy with either of us."

    Sh "Hmm. Well, we are not his property you know and he doesn't need to know!"

    Mls "You are so bad! But I know you're just a tease, you wouldn't really do it anyhow."

    Sh "*Giggles* You got me. [mc] is the only man who continues to resist me for years."

    Sh "So, yes, I would never do anything to make all that progress just go poof up in smoke."

    Mls "Well, if we work together, we could convince him that it's to his benefit..."

    Mls "To let us play together. He is the biggest perv I have ever known."

    Sh "You think he would go for it, just for the perviness factor?"

    Mls "Absolutely, his head would explode just thinking about having the two of us at once."

    Sh "Which head?"

    "" "Both laugh* Hahaha."

    Sh "Okay then, I'll stick to flirting with you and making you horny from a distance."

    Mls "*Moans* Until the time comes... Then I'll make you pay for teasing me with those peaches."

    Sh "You think [mc] likes Alison's watermelons over our smaller tits?"

    Mls "In all honesty, he seems to be obsessed with her ass more than anything else."

    Sh "Oh shit, I am so dead. I have no ass and almost no tits... What do I do now?"

    Mls "Haha, don't look at me! You can't borrow mine either."

    Sh "Haha, it was worth a try."

    Mls "Seriously, though, don't worry too much about it. He mostly cares about the person."

    Sh "Yeah, I know he is a big pervert, but I also know that the size of his heart..."

    Sh "... Is far bigger than his dick."

    Mls "You've actually seen [mc]'s scary monster?"

    Sh "What's scary about it?"

    Sh "And no, not in all of its glory yet... I, uh, rifle scoped it once."

    Mls "You shot at his dick?! I'll strangle you!"

    Sh "No, no! Are you crazy? I said scoped... As in looking through the scope of my rifle."

    Mls "Haha, and I thought [mc] was the Perv."

    Sh "You ain't seen nothing yet. This one time-"
