    Mls "That gave me the strength to get through this."

    Mls "Please, [mc], tell me the truth. Is there any chance of a future for the two of us?"

    Mls "Or is your mind already made up? Alison told me some things, you know."

    M "Yeah, she also gave me your message. And before I answer your question you need to hear me out."

    M "Ever since Jessica went missing, I have done everything in my power to find her."

    M "You were right there with me all along. And although you knew I loved her you never let that stop you from helping me."

    M "Because you were trying to make me happy, even if it was at the expense of your own happiness."

    M "I've known how you feel about me for a while now. I just didn't think I deserved you. In all honesty, I still don't think I do."

    Mls "You trying to decide for me is beyond selfish, [mc]. And that's just not you."

    M "I know. I just... I never thought I'd be good enough for you. I still love her, Mel, and I care about you, as well as Alison."

    M "So if you are asking me to spell it out for you, then I will."

    M "I've been alone for so long, I've forgotten what it's like to not be alone."

    M "Then this young girl comes into my life. And she throws every rule in the book out the window."

    Mls "Haha, yeah that pretty much sums it up. She really is something else."

    M "Well, one thing is for sure. I need you in my life. I want you to be a part of it."

    M "I just don't know if I have it in me to do the whole relationship thing again."

    Mls "I am not asking you to marry me, [mc]. I'm only asking you to let me in."

    Mls "Be open to the possibility. That's all I am asking. I know you care about Alison, I really do understand it."

    Mls "This is as much my fault as yours. Maybe if I'd told you how I felt sooner, who knows what would have happened."

    Mls "But I didn't and then life just happened. She is here to stay, it seems."

    Mls "I just want to be with you. Even if that's selfish of me, I'm not sorry for it."

    M "No matter how hard I try to understand women, I've never been able to. What on earth do you see in me?"

    M "I've killed people for a living. I still do. I've gotten so used to it that I don't even care anymore."

    M "When I came to find you and Alison, I must have killed at least nine people."

    M "I became a cop to try to find out what happened to Jessica after I let her down."

    M "All I had to do was stay when she asked. If I had, then none of this would be happening."

    Mls "But that would mean you would have never met me."

    Mls "And Alison, she would have likely died. Could you go back, knowing that?"

    M "In all honesty. I don't know... Part of me still loves Jessica and the other wants to save this girl."

    M "But am I doing it for her or am I doing it because she reminds me of Jessica and I feel guilty?"

    M "Maybe it's because I somehow feel like this will make up for all the bad things I've done."

    M "I am bitter, hateful, and full of anger. I would bring you nothing but misery."

    M "You have seen firsthand what happens to the people I care about. Things aren't going to get any easier for us, Melissa."

    M "So are you sure you don't want to just walk away and find someone better?"

    M "You are one of the strongest and most amazing women I've ever met. You deserve someone who will always be there for you and only you."

    Mls "I've never been more sure about anything in my entire life."

    Mls "I can't help it. I love you, and whatever happens, I would rather be with you. Even just for a little while."

    J "She is, for lack of a better description, built from scratch and without any flaws. Or so we thought at the time."

    J "Unlike naturally born babies, she was enhanced. You may still remember the term \"designer babies\". "

    E "I do indeed. In fact, I am one of those babies. My parents wanted me to have these good looks as well as increased longevity."

    E "I am grateful to them for doing it. But how does this translate to immortality?"

    J "Alison was injected with nanites that run through her bloodstream 24/7. As you may recall, back in the year 2030, human testing began."

    J "It led to thousands of deaths, due to the nanites replicating endlessly..."

    J "Which inevitably killed the host. After that disaster, all research on that technology was banned."

    J "At least in the public sector. The military, on the other hand, continued testing."

    J "We managed to stop the nanites from killing the host by controlling them. The nanites in Alison are from the second generation."

    J "We came up with an AI system that could be directly interfaced with the human brain."

    J "It responds to needs and wants directly from the brain. It also allows us to take control of the body without its knowledge."

    J "In other words, we could have her kill anyone, anywhere, at any time."

    scene l79

    E "What about the immortality part?"

    J "Well, like I was saying, we solved the issues with the nanites. I was the lead scientist on a project called Alice."

    J "She was meant to be the very first human bioengineered with all the traits of a soldier."

    J "As well as everything else that would allow her to blend in."

    J "We allowed her to age in order to avoid suspicion. We wouldn't want people to become immortal, now, would we?"

    E "No, of course not. Only those who deserve to become gods should be gods!"

    J "Precisely! (He's not half bad after all.)"

    E "Well, just tell me one last thing, my new friend. Can these nanites of yours reverse the effects of aging?"

    J "Absolutely. We've tested the process and aging can be reversed. It is truly a miracle of modern science."

    J "They can cure any known disease even and if it's an unknown disease, the AI will work with the nanites nonstop to find a cure."

    J "They exist only to keep the body alive. Without the nanites, the AI has no purpose."

    J "So you see, it will do everything it can to keep them going which in turn means keeping the host alive for as long as possible."

    J "Aside from something like a large caliber bullet to the brain or being hit by a train at full speed..."

    J "You could survive any injury that didn't result in instant death."

    J "The nanites are even capable of regrowing severed limbs and repairing severely damaged organs."

    E "Absolutely fascinating. So, what went wrong, then?"

    J "That's just it. We don't know for sure. That's why I need her back. I believe someone may have turned her aggression off."

    J "I had her caged and I've tried almost everything to bring it out."

    J "Nothing worked. I did, however, manage to learn a lot about her but I am very concerned, Eric."

    J "I've never seen the AI activate itself in self-defense. It makes no sense! It was intended to control the nanites."

    J "To allow us full control of the host. Not take control of the host and use it against us!"

    J "So we really need to find her while there is still time. If that filthy creature manages to unlock her secret..."

    J "(Or worse, if he touches my Alison, I'll kill him and everyone he loves.)"

    J "(She is mine! She will only be mine! No man but I will have her.)"

    E "Well, out with it then and quit drooling! You'll ruin my carpet."

    "Mayor's Thug" "Yes sir! I placed the bounty on his head as you ordered."

    "Mayor's Thug" "I was also able to find a lot of information on him."

    "Mayor's Thug" "Our contact in the military sent me everything there is."

    "Mayor's Thug" "I'm afraid to even read it to you, sir."
    scene lp47

    E "Stop your babbling and tell me already."

    "Mayor's Thug" "(Oh God. I'm going to die here tonight. She is looking at me.)"

    E "Are you even paying attention?!"

    "Mayor's Thug" "Sorry sir! I was, uh, trying to find the page."

    "Mayor's Thug" "He's an ex-Delta Force member. Honorably discharged."

    "Mayor's Thug" "Uh, my name is a boob... I mean Robert! Bob for short, sir."

    E "Hmm, well, I'm sure you've told me your name before and I forgot."

    "Mayor's Thug" "(Yeah, I've only worked for you for 5 years, you fucking prick.)"

    E "So from now on I'll call you Number One. Okay, Number One?"

    "Number One" "Thank you, sir!"

    "Number One" "*Sniffles* More than you'll ever know, sir."

    E "Alright, alright, here's a tissue. Now carry on with the rest."

    "Number One" "Thank you, sir. There was only one response from the bounty hunters."

    E "One response for a reward of five million dollars?!"

    "Number One" "They requested the target's name and then hung up."

    "Number One" "It looks like they did their own research on him as well."

    "Number One" "My guess is he is a very dangerous man with little to lose."

    E "That's not true anymore. He has a lot to lose now."

    E "Find out everything he has to lose and bring it to me!"

    E "Are you serious right now?"

    "Number One" "Never been stiffer in my life, sir!"

    E "Stiff?"

    "Number One" "I said serious, sir!"

    E "Hmmm, fine. Maybe you did, I do tend to ignore half of what you say."

    "Number One" "Her name is Jessica and I believe she is in our system."

    "Number One" "(Oh man, what I wouldn't give to just get in there for a quickie!)"

    "Number One" "(I love my job! *Cries tears of joy*)"

    E "I am impressed with your dedication to this job. Well done, Number One!"

    E "You will also get a raise this week. Keep up the good work, I expect good things from you."

    "Number One" "Oh thank you, sir! You have no idea how much I love this job right now."

    E "Find out where the girl is being held and see if she is still in one piece."

    E "But do not share this information with anyone else, do you understand me?"

    "Number One" "Loud and clear. (Maybe one day he'll let me take her for a spin.)"

    "Number One" "(Goals, I suppose.)"

    E "Dismissed."

    "Number One" "So pink..."

    E "Very well, I'll make it so, my little slut."

    "Mayor's Fuckdoll" "Thank you, Master."

    E "You are a good little slut, aren't you?"
